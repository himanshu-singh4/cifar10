# cifar10
This project tries to works upon the Image Recognition in the CIFAR 10 dataset. 
The 4 files namely, cache.py, cifar10.py, dataset.py and download.py are the reference files that help downloading and loading the images present in this dataset.
Cifar10_Project(Keras).ipynb builds and trains the CNN model for prediction of outputs. The accuracy Provided is about
# 84%
on test data.

CIfar10.ipynb imports and plot an image reshapes it and predicts the output for it.

# Libraries used :-
1) Keras and Tensorflow
2) Matplotlib
3) Numpy and Pandas
4) OpenCV
5) Skimage
